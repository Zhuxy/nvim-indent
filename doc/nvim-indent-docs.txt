1. INTRODUCTION                                     *nvim-indent-introduction*

`nvim-indent` is a plugin to help you select or operate with texts by indent level.

The basic concept is to select neighboring lines of text base on the indent level under the cursor, make them a kind of |text-objects| for futher operation.

When searching the lines, the *(i)nside* operation means all the neighboring lines whose indent level is equal or lower than the line under the cursor.

And the *(a)round* operation means all the neighboring lines whose indent level is equal or lower than the line under the cursor, plus a upmost line or a downmost line which has a lower indent level if existed.

Can including or excluding any nearest empty line when searching.

    })
